My Portfolio Website
*March 2nd 2022.*

Project #1 at General Assembly.

Personal website displaying my projects and who I am as a Software Engineer.
One of the struggles in the begining was figuring out the footer position (when there is not enough content on the page).
After that the biggest struggle was with carousel images sizes (if they are different sizes, to keep them contained in the exact container size).
